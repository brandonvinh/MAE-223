This was my quarter project for the MAE 223 course at UCSD. Its focus was on developing an ocean sensor to measure wave characteristics such as wave height, period, and frequency. 
My main role was to program the data acquisition software as well as the data processing code in Arduino IDE and MATLAB respectively.
